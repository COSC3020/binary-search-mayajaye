# Binary Search

Implement a binary search function that, given a sorted list and an element to
look for, returns the index of the element in the list or -1 if the element is
not there.

Use the template in `code.js`. The tests in `code.test.js` will be run
automatically every time you push to Github; if they pass you are done.

Help from: Microsoft Copilot

MC: My original binary search did not work with duplicates, so I copied my
    error and code.test.js to Copilot, and it said that the tests check for 
    the first occurrence of the element. I added the 'ele' variable to store 
    the index, but still search the left for an earlier occurrence.
